1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    client side- Javascript handles routing internally on our page. The page doesn't refresh, the data is in state, waiting to be displayed when we request for it. If a user clicks on a request, Js prevents the call from going to the server.
    With server side routing, an external server is handling all of our requests and changes on a web page. The Server will refresh the web page and oly the requested information will be given. We can load smaller portions of the page as opposed to loading the entire page as with client routing.
